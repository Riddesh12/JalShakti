# 💧 Real-time Groundwater Resource Evaluation using DWLR Data

### 🏆 Smart India Hackathon (SIH) Project

**Organization:** Ministry of Jal Shakti (MoJS)

**Department:** Central Ground Water Board (CGWB)

**Domain:** Water Resource Management

---

## 🧠 Overview

Groundwater is the backbone of India’s water supply for drinking, agriculture, and industry. However, uneven resource distribution and overexploitation have created alarming depletion in many regions. To address this challenge, our team developed a **mobile application** that evaluates groundwater resources **in real time** using **DWLR (Digital Water Level Recorder)** data.

This system provides real-time visualization, dynamic recharge estimation, and data-driven decision support — enabling sustainable groundwater management and resource planning.

---

## 🌍 Background

India, covering **3.3 million sq. km**, houses **16% of the world’s population** but has access to only **4% of global freshwater resources**.
With rising demand and changing climate conditions, there is an urgent need for:

* Continuous groundwater monitoring
* Accurate estimation of recharge
* Scientific data for policy and decision-making

Resource knowledge is the foundation of effective groundwater management — and this project directly contributes to that goal.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

We designed a **mobile application** that integrates and analyzes data from **5,260 DWLR (Digital Water Level Recorder)** stations across the country.
These DWLR stations record **high-frequency groundwater levels**, which can be processed to:

* 📊 **Analyze real-time water level fluctuations**
* 💧 **Estimate recharge dynamically**
* 🌦️ **Evaluate groundwater availability in real time**

The platform provides **visual analytics**, **predictive insights**, and **decision-support features** for researchers, planners, and policymakers.

## 🛠️ System Architecture

1. **Data Collection Layer:**
   Collects real-time DWLR data through APIs or IoT-based data ingestion pipelines.

2. **Data Processing & Analytics:**

   * Filters and validates raw DWLR data.
   * Performs time-series and recharge estimation analysis.
   * Stores processed data in a cloud database.

3. **Visualization & Decision Layer:**

   * Displays trends, graphs, and groundwater levels through interactive dashboards.
   * Provides insights and recommendations for sustainable management.
